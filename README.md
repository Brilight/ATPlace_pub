# ATPlace2..5D üåü

This repository contains the public materials for the ICCAD 2024 paper **ATPlace2.5D**. Due to intellectual property restrictions, we are unable to directly provide the core code of ATPlace üîí. However, this repository includes the following resources:

1. **Test Cases**: A set of test cases used in our experiments.
2. **Thermal Configuration**: The thermal setup used in our work, which is processed using [HotSpot](https://github.com/uvahotspot/HotSpot.git). You can compile HotSpot-7.0 on your own üíª.
3. **Partial Code**: A subset of the TAP2.5D codebase üß©.

In the future, we plan to release a compiled version of the ATPlace code to further support research in this area üöÄ.

## Repository Contents üìÇ

### Test Cases 
The test cases are organized into **10 folders** (`Case1` to `Case10`), each containing the following files:
- **Chiplet Geometric Sizes**: `*.blocks` files that define the geometric sizes of chiplets.
- **Nets**: `*.nets` files that describe the netlist connectivity.
- **Pin Locations**: `*.pl` files that specify the pin locations.
- **Chiplet Power**: `*.power` files that define the power consumption of chiplets.

These files are formatted based on the **Bookshelf format**, a widely-used standard in placement research. If you need a parser for the Bookshelf format, you can refer to other repositories or tools available online.

### Thermal Configuration üî•
The thermal modeling is performed using **HotSpot-7.0**, an open-source thermal modeling tool. To use the thermal configuration provided here, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download HotSpot-7.0 from its official repository at https://github.com/uvahotspot/HotSpot.git.
2. Compile HotSpot-7.0 on your system.
3. Use the thermal configuration files provided in this repository as input to HotSpot.

## Future Plans ü§ù
We are committed to open-sourcing more components of ATPlace in the future. Specifically, we plan to release a compiled version of the ATPlace code to enable researchers to reproduce and build upon our work.

## How to Use This Repository üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brilight/ATPlace_pub.git
2. Explore the test cases in the cases directory.
3. Set up HotSpot-7.0 and use the provided thermal configuration files for thermal modeling.
4. Results can be compared with the published data in our paper.
